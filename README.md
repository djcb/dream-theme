# dream-theme

*dream-theme* is a darkish theme for GNU/Emacs, inspired by other themes such as Zenburn and Nordic,
but with its own character. It tries to be somewhat maximalist -- that is, it adds a lot of
package-specific faces.

*dream-theme* is my work-horse theme, used during development for tools like https://github.com/djcb/mu.
